# Enhancing Semantic Image Understanding with Fine-Tuned CLIP
In this project, I fine-tuned the image encoder of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) using pairs of images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal was to enhance the model's ability to make images within the same class more similar while making images from different classes more dissimilar. To achieve this, I employed a custom loss function designed to encourage the model to learn meaningful representations of images based on their semantic content.

The custom loss function leverages cosine similarity between the embeddings of two images. By maximizing the cosine similarity for images within the same class and minimizing it for images from different classes, the model learns to effectively discriminate between different classes while capturing the underlying similarities within each class.

Let $S_{i,j}$ represent the cosine similarity between embedding vectors $\text{emb}_i$ and $\text{emb}_j$.

The loss $L_{i,j}$ between embeddings $\text{emb}_i$ and $\text{emb}_j$ can be defined as:

$\[ L_{i,j} = (1 - \text{label}) \times S_{i,j} + \text{label} \times (1 - S_{i,j}) \]$

where $\text{label}$ is a binary indicator variable defined as follows:
- $\text{label} = 1$ if $\text{emb}_i$ and $\text{emb}_j$ belong to the same class,
- $\text{label} = 0$ otherwise.




This approach is particularly fascinating for image search and retrieval tasks. By embedding images into a shared semantic space, we enable efficient similarity-based retrieval. This means that given a query image, we can retrieve images with similar semantic content from a large dataset. This capability has numerous applications, from content-based image retrieval in digital libraries to visual search in e-commerce platforms. By fine-tuning CLIP in this manner, we not only enhance its performance on classification tasks but also empower it for various downstream applications requiring image understanding and retrieval.
